Powered by React JS and a machine learning model, it not only forecasts food program demands but also suggests recipes for users living in various states based on common local ingredients. To accomplish these tasks norishNow leverages the power of a predictive modelling by using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and trained on data sourced from Kaggle resulting in 2nd in the Zero Hunger Hack category at Maple-Hacks 2023.";

On spotifyBot, users can download their favourite Spotify playlists as local .mp3 files through the Spotify SDK and YouTube API and listen to their music on a shuffle feature which personalizes recommendation using machine learning. To build this, spotifyBot‚Äôs UI was coded using React-JS while its backend is made using a combination of a Flask API and a locally hosted MySQL database.";
const hoverTouchDescrip = "hoverTouch is a touchless software application that ingeniously turns your index finger into a virtual stylus. This app allows users to write in the air, effortlessly converting these finger-written notes into typed text or audio with image recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. Before being analyzed by the Google Vision and TTS APIs, each note is refined through a specialized image masking process. Developing HoverTouch was a pivotal experience for me, marking my first hackathon experience which resulted in 4th place at Hack Western 9.";
